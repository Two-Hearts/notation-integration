# Sign an image with Notation in GitHub Actions

This document walks you through how to create a GitHub Actions workflow to achieve the following goals:

1. Build an image and push it to Azure Container Registry (ACR).
2. Sign the image with Notation and Notation AKV plugin with a signing key stored in Azure Key Vault (AKV). The generated signature is automatically pushed to ACR.

## Prerequisites

- You have created a Key Vault in AKV and created a self-signed signing key and certificate. You can follow this [doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-tutorial-sign-build-push#create-a-self-signed-certificate-azure-cli) to create self-signed key and certificate for testing purposes. 
- You have created a registry in Azure Container Registry.
- You have a GitHub repository to store the sample workflow file and GitHub Secrets.

## Authenticate from Azure to GitHub
There are two ways to connect GitHub Actions to your ACR and AKV, pick one of them based on your needs:
1. [Use the Azure login action with a service principal secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Clinux#use-the-azure-login-action-with-a-service-principal-secret)
2. [Use the Azure login action with OpenID Connect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Clinux#use-the-azure-login-action-with-openid-connect)

### Use the Azure login action with a service principal secret

Enter your GitHub repository, create an encrypted secret `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in the repository to authenticate with ACR and AKV. See [creating encrypted secrets for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) for details.

Follow the steps below to get the value of `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. 

- Execute the following commands to create a new service principal on Azure. 

```
# Log in to Azure CLI
az login

# Create a new service principal with AcrPush role
spn={service_principal_name}
acr_scope=/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group}
az ad sp create-for-rbac -n $spn --scopes $acr_scope --role acrpush --sdk-auth
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. Copy the entire JSON output from the `az ad sp` command execution result into the **Secret** filed of `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. See [this doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Cwindows#add-the-service-principal-as-a-github-secret) for reference.
>
> 2. Save the `clientId` from the JSON output into an environment variable (without double quotes) as it will be needed in the next step:
>```
>  clientId={clientId_from_JSON_output_of_last_step}
>```

- Grant the AKV access permissions to the service principal that we created in the previous step.

```
# set policy for your AKV
akv={your_akv_name}
az keyvault set-policy --name $akv --spn $clientId --certificate-permissions get --key-permissions sign --secret-permissions get
```

See [az keyvault set-policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/keyvault?view=azure-cli-latest#az-keyvault-set-policy) for reference.

### Use the Azure login action with OpenID Connect (OIDC)

Create an Access Policy under your AKV following [this doc](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/assign-access-policy?branch=pr-en-us-248675&tabs=azure-portal).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to enable the following AKV permissions:
> 1. Key permissions: Sign
> 2. Secret permissions: Get
> 3. Certificate permissions: Get

On success, the application will be displayed under "App registrations" in Azure portal. From there, follow [this doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Clinux#add-federated-credentials) to add a federated credential to your application.

Then follow [this doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Clinux#create-github-secrets) to add GitHub Secrets. They are `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, and `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.

Next, run the following commands to authenticate from ACR
```
# Assign AcrPush role to your application
AZURE_CLIENT_ID={Application (client) ID from last step}
acr_scope=/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group}
az role assignment create --assignee $AZURE_CLIENT_ID --scopes $acr_scope --role acrpush
```

## Create the GitHub Actions workflow

- Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.

- In the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file named `{your_workflow}.yml`. 

- You can copy the [signing template workflow](https://github.com/notation-playground/notation-integration-with-ACR-and-AKV/blob/template/sign-template.yml) from the collapsed section below into your own `{your_workflow}.yml` file.

- Update the environmental variables based on your environment by following the comments in the template. Save and commit it to the repository.

## Trigger the GitHub Actions workflow

The workflow trigger logic has been set to `on: push` [event](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#using-events-to-trigger-workflows) in the sample workflow. Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.

On success, you will be able to see the image is built and pushed to your ACR with a COSE format signature attached.

Another use case is to trigger the workflow when a new tag is pushed to the Github repository. See [this doc](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#example-excluding-branches-and-tags) for details. It is typical to secure a software release process with the trigger event in the GitHub Actions.
